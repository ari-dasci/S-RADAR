# Robust Anomaly Detection And Recognition (RADAR)  

## 📌 Description  
**Robust Anomaly Detection And Recognition (RADAR)** is an **anomaly detection** platform designed to unify and integrate diverse approaches and libraries from the literature, along with innovative model variants. The goal is to provide a flexible and extensible framework that ranges from classical methods to advanced techniques based on Transformer architectures, also including support for Federated Learning in distributed scenarios. For more details, refer to the official documentation [here](https://s-radar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Specifically, it includes:  
- **Classical methods for static data:** integration with [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).  
- **Time series and deep learning models:** integration with libraries such as [TSFE-DL](https://github.com/ari-dasci/S-TSFE-DL.git).  
- **Representative Transformer models:** Informer, Autoformer, and Vanilla Transformer (implemented within the `time_series/` folder).  
- **Federated anomaly detection:** integration with [flex-anomalies](https://github.com/FLEXible-FL/flex-anomalies.git), developed as part of the Flexible platform.

## 🧪 Examples and Utilities

The library provides a set of practical examples and utilities to make experimentation easier:

- **Test Notebooks:** The `notebooks_test/` folder contains a notebook for each library integration, showing how to use the algorithms with different types of data.  
- **Preprocessing Scripts:** Each `time_series/` and `static_data/` folder includes a `preprocessing/` folder with techniques tailored to the specific data type:  
  - `preprocessing/preprocessing_static.py` for static data  
  - `preprocessing/preprocessing_ts.py` for time series data  
- **Dataset Loaders:** The same folders provide a `datasets_uci.py` file with functions to load datasets from the UCI repository, making it easy to test and experiment with the library:  
  - `static_datasets_uci.py` for static data  
  - `time_series_datasets_uci.py` for time series data
- **Metrics:** `metrics_module.py` provides evaluation metrics for anomaly detection.  
- **Visualization:** `visualization_module.py` includes functions to plot results and anomalies.  
- **Post-processing:** `pos_process_module.py` computes anomaly labels from predictions.
    
Note that `federated_data/` does not contain its own preprocessing or dataset loader scripts, since it can work with either static or time series data. The example notebooks cover usage for both types.    
  
This setup allows users to explore the library’s functionality, apply the appropriate preprocessing, and test algorithms on real datasets efficiently.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ari-dasci/RADAR.git
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Terminal experiments

The notebook experiments for Transformer, TSFEDL, and FlexAnomalies time-series models also have terminal-ready entry points in [scripts](scripts):

- [scripts/experiment_transformers_models.py](scripts/experiment_transformers_models.py)
- [scripts/experiment_tsfedl_models.py](scripts/experiment_tsfedl_models.py)
- [scripts/experiment_flexanomalies_time_series.py](scripts/experiment_flexanomalies_time_series.py)

Each script keeps the notebook defaults but can be launched as a regular `main` process, for example:

```bash
python scripts/experiment_transformers_models.py --results-dir results
python scripts/experiment_tsfedl_models.py --results-dir results
python scripts/experiment_flexanomalies_time_series.py --results-dir results
```

For Slurm environments, ready-to-edit launchers are included in [scripts/slurm](scripts/slurm):

```bash
sbatch scripts/slurm/experiment_transformers_models.sbatch
sbatch scripts/slurm/experiment_tsfedl_models.sbatch
sbatch scripts/slurm/experiment_flexanomalies_time_series.sbatch
```
